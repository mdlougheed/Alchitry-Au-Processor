# Alchitry-Au-Processor Example
LUCID HDL CPU example project from Chapter 9 - A Basic Processor - Learning FPGAs by Justin Rajewski.  

Tuned up to run on the Alchitry Au FPGA board.
Known to sucessfully synthesize using Alchitry Labs (1.2.7) + Xilinx Vivado (2019.1)

For all you Verilog purists - Don't freak out! LUCID source translates to Verilog during Alchitry Labs build cycle.
